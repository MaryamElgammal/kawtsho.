<h2>[Executive Summary] </h2>
<p>Provide a brief summary of your startup idea, what problem you are solving, and why it is unique.

-Our project is to reduce environmental pollution by recycling car tires with the help of homeless children
the problem: -
The project discusses two problems
The first is environmental:
It is an increase in the number of damaged car tires, which in one year reaches 20.7 million damaged tires in Egypt only.

The Arab world consumes 200 million tires every year

They are disposed of in two ways, by burning or burying, which causes severe damage to the environment and people


The second is societal:
It is the increase in the number of homeless children registered between 600 thousand: 2 million children with their families or alone distributed over 10 governorates (2021 statistics) </p>

 <h2>[Company Overview]</h2>

Exporting a local product to all countries.
- Opening work doors for many families of women and youth.

<h2> [Market Analysis] </h2>
<p>Analyze the market you are targeting. Discuss the size of the market, growth trends, and major competitors. Identify your unique selling proposition (USP) and how it will differentiate you from your competitors.

Ladies in particular are lovers of unique pieces

+ Market size Egypt consumes 20.7 million car tires, which represents 98% of Egypt's consumption
 Of the imported tires available in the Egyptian market

+ Competitors in the tire chopping department, as the number of workshops and factories is not large.
In the furniture department, few products are made that are similar in idea without creating a new one.
The accessories   and clothing department is from the rubber, so do not compete with it yet.

+ The advantage of the project is a safe product - unique designs - designs that can be disassembled, installed and easy to store</p>
